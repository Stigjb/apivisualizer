# Air pollution visualization

A visualization of historical air pollution data from measuring stations
in Oslo. Uses Chart.js to draw the graphs. The website is accessible at
<https://luftkvalitet-visualisering.herokuapp.com>

The module [highestproduct.py](./apivisualizer/highestproduct.py) contains an
algorithm to calculate the highest product between three numbers in a list
containing arbitrarily many integers. The algorithm is described in the
docstring for the function. Tests for the algorithm are found in
[test_highestproduct.py](./tests/test_highestproduct.py).

The algorithm can also be used through the website at
<https://luftkvalitet-visualisering.herokuapp.com/highest_product>.
